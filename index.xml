If you encounter a bug, or any issue with the items, please report it in our Discord Support channel. Our plugin allows us to ban the items in a way that allows you to still progress through the pack. Craft, Place, Use, and Near are all the different ways items can be banned.</description></item><item><title>Basic Commands</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/commands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/wiki/commands/</guid><description>Basic Commands Argument Required &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Required [] Optional Discord In order to join discord, you need to run the command /discord in game, this will give you the invite link in your chat window.

There are two types of Chunk Loaders, Always On and Online Only. To view chunk borders, hit F3+g
The most basic command in the plugin is /betterchunkloader, or just /bcl for short. Executing this command will open an interface in the chat that the user may interact with.</description></item><item><title>Ranks</title><link>https://shadownode.github.io/server-info/ranks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shadownode.github.io/server-info/ranks/</guid><description>Available Ranks On the server we have multiple ranks that you can contribute to acquire.
